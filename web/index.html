  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Why to choose online voting?</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Vote at any time from anywhere: </strong><p>Today's way of living doesn't leave much free time. We have little to no time to do anything or go anywhere. So don't you think that maybe giving the chance to the members of your organization to cast their vote in just a few minutes, without the need to go to a certain place, would be a good option? If your answer is ?yes?, then you should probably consider online voting. Unlike traditional voting, that makes voters go to a specific place at a specific time in order to vote, online voting allows them to cast their vote at any time of the day and from any place, just with the need of an Internet connection.</p></li>
      <li><strong>Boost Participation: </strong><p>As a result of the previous point, choosing online voting for your election will more likely boost the participation. You will give the chance to members that otherwise may not be able to vote. At this point, you might be thinking "what about the people that for any reason can't vote online, wouldn't we lose their participation then?". I have good news for you: running an electoral process online does not mean that you have to discard traditional voting. This is not one thing or the other.</p></li>
      <li><strong>Less Physical Infrastructure</strong><p>When running a voting online, you avoid the need for all the physical infrastructure usually required on a traditional voting. No need of paper, printing, physical urns or staff may, therefore, lead to a lower monetary investment.</p></li>
      <li><strong>Fast and easy votes tally</strong><p>Since the tally in online voting is run by machines, you can assure that it will not have human counting errors and that it will in most cases run faster than a count carried out by persons, so the results of your election will be available sooner.</p></li>
